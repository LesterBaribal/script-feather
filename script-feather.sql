There was a bullet, slowly\r\nhovering, spinning horizontally, coming for my thick skull. I can dodge, but I\r\nknow I mustn’t. I can feel someone’s hollow breath at my nape, so I let that\r\ntiny metal open my skull, letting it splatter my brain. Allowing black blood to\r\nleak from a nutshell. Finally.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But I—I think... I think I was mistaken.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The next thing I knew was my back was lying in a soft and\r\nwarm bed, an eerie noise of rustling leaves outside, my heart was punching my\r\nribcage, and an ambulance’s siren ripping the silence apart. I don’t know if\r\nit\'s still part of my dream, but I was sure that I just heard it passed my\r\nhouse. My world spin around me as I stood, the floor waved in every direction,\r\ndisorganizing my toy figurine in my tabletops when I went searching for my\r\nbathroom.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“A dream,” I sighed. Too soft that even I didn’t hear it\r\nproperly. Too animated that I didn’t even believe.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My reflection was paper-white, things around me were still\r\ndancing, swaying, spinning. Guts wanted to turn inside-out. Clothes are\r\nsticking on my skin even though the cooling system was working well.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A dream of me, being killed aside, the next day started\r\npretty… odd.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I woke up with the sound of rasping knocks on my door. And\r\nmy sister entered. But something was different, her eyes are heavy and swallow.\r\nHer hair seems like having a civil war. Her face cannot be painted.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She entered, not looking at me, in my direction. She stood\r\nthere, at the foot of my bed, for a few minutes, staring, not moving, with her\r\nhead tilted to her left.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Something was wrong. I can’t see her feet but there was\r\nsmoke coming from where she stood. Black, more like a wisp, slow-moving.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Fire!” I blurted.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then she snapped, scanned my room with a confused face, and\r\nleave without a single word.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jumped out of my bed, look where she stood but there was no\r\nsign of burnt carpet.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I went down to the kitchen without considering bathing.\r\nHell, I can’t run naked outside if there was really a fire.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">There was no fire, but the smoke was still there, coming\r\nfrom where my sister steps. Even my in my brother’s.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What’s—” I stopped when I saw their faces. Somehow, they\r\nare slow-moving, lifeless, looking at the floor. They are taking a deep breath\r\nafter a deep breath.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brother was uncomfortably silent at the table. Not smiling.\r\nNot scowling. Just staring at his food as if he was waiting for it to speak to\r\nhim. I wanted to ask him why, what’s the matter. But I bit my tongue before I\r\ndid spoke those words.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He hates being questioned. He hates the way I look at him.\r\nHe hates my tone. He hates me, in general.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I preferred him this way. At least I won’t hear how\r\ndisappointing I am.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We all eat in silence. Or should I say, they eat in silence?\r\nI leave my foods untouched. I don’t feel hungry.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I don’t know why, but I smiled while waiting for them. I\r\nain’t happy, but for no reason, I felt relieved. I set my worries about those\r\nsmokes aside. What makes them so dreary?<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I waited for them to return in their happy states, and make\r\nme jump in my feet, to tell they’re just pranking me. I waited for my brother\r\nto shout, my sister to make fun of me, poke me in my head. But the table was\r\nalready cleaned it didn’t come.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They are acting like I didn’t exist. Something was bothering\r\nthem. I was curious but I didn’t ask them. Curiosity kills.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I kept my curiosity at bay and grab my bag and set my way\r\nfor my school. My stomach was empty, but being emotionally and physically\r\nunhurt was a change, I wasn’t hungry anyway.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But terror filled me inside. Everywhere I look, whichever\r\ndirection I took, whenever there are people, there was smoke coming from the\r\nground from where they stepped. It was filling the atmosphere, on different\r\nshades of black and white, but nobody seemed to notice. I wanted to study one\r\nfootprint they left behind but the moment I was near to the thing it already\r\nfaded.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I looked down on my own but there was nothing. I was\r\nrelieved.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Those smokes look like it was hurting no one, so I decided\r\nto ignore it. But it was difficult, when there was a big crowd before you, it\r\nwas suffocating, it\'s driving me insane, or shoving.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When I turned into a corner, to the plaza, my usual\r\nthirty-minute walk turned into an hour. I spun around and took a long way\r\ninstead. There was a massive wave of people, pushing each other out of their\r\nway. It was chaotic enough when there are no smokes involved. But the scene\r\nlooks like I was in a horror movie. No thanks, I can risk being late for\r\nschool.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My brain was occupied thus I reached the school without\r\nknowing when, why, and how.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I opened my classroom door, expecting a bunch of crumpled\r\npaper will hit my head, the teacher shouting at me. But it didn’t come.\r\nInstead, all eyes are in my direction. Their faces telling me that they just\r\nsaw me twerk or pole dance. Some look confused meeting their seatmates’ eyes\r\nnervously.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mrs. Racal, my math teacher, walked in my direction. I was\r\nexpecting she’ll drag me in the middle with her fingers on my left ears,\r\nlecturing how unproductive I am.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But she aims to the door behind me instead. I just got\r\nlucky; I manage to pull my left elbow out of the door\'s reach before agony\r\ncomes.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Stop stalling, go back to your work!” snapped Mrs. Racal.\r\nThen a ruffle of papers comes next.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I navigated my place at the back of the classroom, expecting\r\na foot will come in my way, but I reached my chair without tripping in the\r\nmiddle of the room. Without their fingers pointing at me. Without the teachers\r\nemphasizing how clumsy I am.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I smiled. I am not everyone’s business anymore. I hope\r\nthey’ll stay like this, forever. I don’t mind those smokes if it’s the\r\nconsequence.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At lunchtime, I can’t believe it, all my morning classes are\r\nsimilar to the first one. I need to savor this moment.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I went to the library instead of the cafeteria. Who knows,\r\nmaybe they are just acting this morning, I won’t take a risk.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then I found no food container inside my bag. I look out the\r\nwindow beside me, I knew it, I whispered followed by a long sigh. But I care\r\nless anyway. It didn’t bother me my food was gone, they can eat it if they\r\nwant. For some reason, I don’t feel hungry, even if my stomach were still\r\nempty. Besides, foods aren’t allowed inside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are two hours of vacant time before my first class\r\nthis afternoon. I look around, it’s only me and, probably, the librarian\r\ninside. Outside, students were eating under the shed, laughing with their\r\npeers. They’ve still got that smoke thing attached in their foot.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Automatically, my arms formed across on the table and my\r\nhead slowly tipped on top of it with my eye still on the outside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I guess five minutes passed when someone speaks in front of\r\nme. “Would you mind if I sit here?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I look at the guy opposite me and I scanned the surrounding,\r\nstill, the library was empty. Jack can sit on those of those tables, but I\r\nshook my head.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Thanks,” Jack smiled and take a chair opposite mine. “You\r\nknow that foods aren’t allowed inside the library,” he said without looking at\r\nme. He was busy with his bag.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“But…” he sang, “if, and only if,” he said giving me\r\nmischievous smile, his hands were still inside his bag, “there are no shelves\r\nfilled with books between you and the librarian.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He pulled out a food container in rush. Too much rushing\r\nthat he created a noise of cutlery. We both winced and freeze for a moment,\r\nlistening for a sign if the monsters are coming.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Man, I was starving,” he hissed when we are sure that the\r\ndanger won’t come. But before eating, he cut his lunch into two, placed the\r\nhalf in the lid of his food container, and pushed it to me.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I shook my head.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Oh, come on,” Jack said, insisting.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I pushed it back as an answer and looked outside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But he was not yet finished. Moments after, he said,\r\n“aaaaaaaaaa!”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I looked at him and his spoon almost touched my lips. I draw\r\nbackward and shook my head.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Rob, you have to eat—and don’t tell me you are not hungry,\r\nI know your lunch is missing,” he said, pouting.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I shook my head.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Please.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I looked at him, in his eye for a moment, then bowed my\r\nhead.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Fine,” he said softly, “but please eat some snacks before\r\nyour class. You have money, right?” I nodded, still not looking at him. “Oh, I\r\nwasn’t convinced. Tell me, did they empty your pockets, again?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“They ignored me this morning.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The truth,” he said while chewing his foods. Though, I can\r\nstill sense the anger in his voice.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“They ignored me this morning,” I repeated looking at his\r\neyes. Smiling.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Good,” he said beaming. “Because if they do, our janitor\r\nwill receive their salaries even without working for a month.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Silence followed that. He occasionally offering me some\r\nfood, but I always decline. I don’t get why he is so nice to me. Half of the\r\nrecord in the detention office was filled because of him, because of me.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My fights became his fights. His superiority cloaked me from\r\nbeing killed. I’ve never asked for his help, but he keeps on helping me. He\r\nbecame more brother to me than my actual brother.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I want to fight back, but before I could throw any punch,\r\nhe’ll barricade himself in front of me, pen on his right and form in the other.\r\nAn omen telling there will be other students who’ll get detention or worst\r\nsuspended.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He knew I don’t know to fight, I’m clumsy, skinny, and paper\r\nlight. And I took that advantage. But next year, he’ll graduate, going to college,\r\nwhile I’m stuck here for four more years. I don’t know what to do then.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He’s done eating then I saw something I haven’t notice\r\nbefore. And on top of that, I remembered something he told me before. Smokes,\r\nhe can see them too.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Huh,” I hummed nervously.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He looked at me, his back was arched in his sit, lazily\r\npatting his belly. “Hmm? You hungry?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“No.” I looked to his side where the smoke was visible, he\r\nlooked at it too. “Smokes, I can see them.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You do?” he said excitedly. He slammed his hands-on table\r\nand gained a shout from the librarian. “Really?” he said quietly.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I nodded. “So, ghost? You were telling me you can se—”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I never lied to you, Little Robin.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“S-sorry, I thought you were just making just making fun of\r\nme that time.” I honestly didn’t believe him that time, we just knew each other\r\nfor five days. “What are those?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Actually, I don’t really know.” His face saddened, hands\r\ntwisting the other. “It’s just, one day after I almost killed someone—remember\r\nthat?” He pointed a finger gun in his temple, pulling an imaginary finger. “I\r\nstarted seeing things.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I looked outside and nodded. Another thing that I assumed\r\none of his bluffs.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Anyways,” he said after a long silence, face turning into a\r\nlecturing state. “I think, those are a projection of our personality, or at\r\nleast my assumptions from my observations. You know, like a — how to say this?\r\n— um, how storm clouds directing the day’s weather. I called it as our\r\n‘essence.’”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I nodded. Now I wanted to ask him loads of questions. Why he\r\nalmost become a murderer? Why, of all people, he chooses to trust me? Why me?\r\nBut I didn’t ask.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Smokes from their feet, it’s always like that,” he\r\ncontinued. “But yours was different.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I give him a questioning look. “Huh?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Yours got a distinct tentacle-like shape. And instead of a\r\nshade of black, it’s a translucent gold.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I glance at my feet, but nothing was there.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“My brother got the same as yours; the shape, then color,\r\nand the translucency. But I never saw that essence again, at least not until I\r\nmeet you.” He sighed. “I was curious. Now I know, you two cloned each other.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I don’t know about this. I assumed that he got no siblings,\r\nhe never tells me a story about them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But he spoke first before I did. “But Robin?” The look he\r\nwas giving me was unsettling me. “Tell me, are you in trouble?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Huh?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Yours went since morning.” Still looking in my eyes,\r\n“what’s wrong?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gone? Wrong?<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Everything, I wanted to say. Since this morning, my sister,\r\nmy brother, my classmates, and my teachers, all are gloomy, all changed.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I reverted my look, to my lap. But I can feel his eyes are\r\nfixed on me, it was heavy.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“You know what,” he said but I was still looking at my lap.\r\nI heard an empty plastic container shut its lids, clattering silverware, and\r\nunzipping and zipping of the bag. “If they are still making fun of you, just\r\ntell me. Okay?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I remain silent. What’s wrong? They are ignoring me, I want\r\nthat. But I felt everything was wrong.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“And don’t worry about those smokes you are seeing. It won’t\r\nharm you.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Everything was wrong! I wanted to say, I was ready. But the\r\nbell defeated me.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Oh crap!” he said looking around, “that’s my queue. Eat\r\nsomething, I’ll check you between my classes, in your room.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I watched him vanished behind the shelves, thinking about\r\nthose smiles he has just given to me. His lips were curling upwards, reflecting\r\nhappiness, but his eyes were telling otherwise. Behind those glints in the\r\ncorner of his eyes, sadness prevails.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The afternoon class copied my morning class. Jack passed\r\noutside my classroom, five times, waving at me, smiling. Sometimes winking. I\r\nwas sure of it and my whole body was melting every time. I know, I know, it’s\r\nweird.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">But for the sixth time, he wasn’t smiling anymore. He didn’t\r\njust walk by, instead, he stopped there, on the other side of the door, where\r\nhe can see me clearly. His back against the wall, the face was blank, his mouth\r\nwas hanging open, staring at me, empty, eyes and cheeks are puffy. He was distant,\r\nbut I can hear his sniffing.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He was standing on the same spot for ten minutes, and I was\r\ngetting anxious. Other students, in the hall, are talking to him, probably\r\nchecking if he was okay, then walk away.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My teacher was focused on his textbook. I was already\r\nstanding, but when I caught Jack’s eyes, he shook his head, wipe his tears and\r\nmounted, later, and walk away.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He didn’t return after that. It’s not like him to get upset\r\nlike that. I still have thirty minutes before they call it the day. I keep on\r\nglancing at the wall clock, my foot got a brain on its own and started tapping.\r\nTen minutes before ending, my pen was dancing in my hand. And finally, “for\r\nyour assignment, do a research about different lenses,” the bell rang.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I reached for my bag, but it wasn’t there, then I suddenly\r\nthink, why am I looking for my bag? Then, leave it. Then, but my things? Then,\r\ndo I have a bag? That’s great. Now, where is it?<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I give up and made it in the hallway. Jack was leaning near\r\nthe gate, looking at his flip phone in his left hand, a book about business on\r\nthe other.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’ll walk you on your house,” he said looking on the floor,\r\nhis phone was in his ears when I was in front of him.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“What was that? Why are you—?”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Later.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I stop walking. Look at him. His eyes meet mine.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Come on,” he said, smiling at me this time, and leading the\r\nway.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was thirty minutes journey back home. And ninety-nine\r\npercent of it filled with silence. I wanted to break it. I wanted to ask more\r\nabout those ‘smoke thingy,\' made him talk, grab him, pushed him, annoy him. Or\r\nanything, just to make him noisy, he wasn’t like this. Never silent, or sad.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He led me like he’d been in my place before, he never did. I\r\ndid nothing but follow him, looking at smokes coming from his foot.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We reached my house, and something was off the order,\r\neverything. Inside and out, people are coming. From the windows, I can see it\r\ninside was filled with smoke.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I saw my brother and sister; mother and father were even\r\nthere, talking with our visitors. They are all wearing black.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sister spotted us first, tugged brother’s sleeve, and meet\r\nus before we enter the gate. But like this morning, they ignored me and\r\nentertained only Jack. “I want to see him,” Jack said to them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They nodded and lead us inside, which added to my confusion.\r\nIn the living room, the couch was pushed in the side. White flowers are\r\neverywhere. And in the middle, was a white coffin with a burning candle on each\r\nside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My head was spinning, I look for my sister and brother for\r\nan explanation, but they are still ignoring me. Who’s dead? I saw mother and\r\nfather when we arrived.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I wanted to peek, but Jack spoke. “No don’t.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I looked at him, but his phone was in his ears again, but he\r\nwas looking straight into my eyes. “Not until I said you this.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My brother and sister look at each other, looked at him, and\r\nin my direction. Their faces were confused. We stopped in the doorway, blocking\r\nthe entrance.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I was grateful to we have met,” Jack continued still\r\nlooking at me, his voice was soft and silent that only me and my siblings can\r\nhear. Tears started to leak from his eyes. He was speaking to me, but why the\r\nphone? Why the tears? My brother pats him in the back as they are being called,\r\nJack nodded. They still ignored me.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to protect you until the last,”\r\nJack choked and walked for the coffin. His hand on my back.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">No! Five steps and I saw who’s inside.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My twin, sleeping peacefully, inside the coffin.
